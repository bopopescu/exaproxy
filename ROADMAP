BUG Fixes:
 - fix all XXX:

Reliablity:
 - look at tox: http://tox.testrun.org/latest/
 - implement the timeout of client sockets.
 - warning when we are reaching 90% connection limit
 - do not rely on remote Google JS code should the proxy not have no net access ( !!! .... )

RFC Compliance
 - consider adding a VIA header to the answer from the server (not done to save CPU)
 - need to serve a HTTP/1.0 via the built-in webserver if the request is 1.0
 - need to remove connection: header if HTTP is 1/0
 - support 100-continue ? (Section 8.2.3)
 - do not forward 100 response due to Expect:100 if client is HTTP/1.0 (Section 8.2.3)
 - pass the REQUEST HTTP version all the way to the HTTP page generated in response
 - 414 Request-URI Too Long instead of aborting the request

Protection
 - incomming IP ACL (for allowed users) - for the moment the firewall of the machine will do ..

Performance
 - use ctypes and the linux splice system call for better performance
 - remove a double dict lookup in the main loop
 - look at python Buffer and Array API
 - look at python 2.7 performance for list.join vs string appending
 - investigate regex for header parsing performance
 - investigate why pypy takes more CPU than cPython in some cases
 - split the worker forking to another process as the process can use several GB of memory when it happens

Cleanup
 - refactor the communication over pipe to have the serialisation/deserialisation in one place
 - use some structure when passing message for readability
 - configuration should not be stored in object as it prevents reload (unless required)

Feature
 - offer an option for happy Eyeballs (RFC 6555) when it comes to IPv6 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6555)
 - fetch the SSL X.509 certificate from IPs to extract its hostname and pass it to the thread when using CONNECT
 - more monitoring (self-updating page with realtime rotating logs)
 - a redirector which connects to our ICAP service
 - option to prever IPv6 DNS answers over IPv4 or vice-versa
 - record data transfered ?
 - show number of connections per ip on the webpage
 - ability for the process to request a recording of the steam

 Fun
  - make a redirector which blocks all old version of IE
