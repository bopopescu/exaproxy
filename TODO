Before realase :
 - fix all XXX:
 - http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2068#section-13.5.1
 - check any possible socket issues, to make sure all exception were traped (all errno are covered)
 - have a 127.0.0.1:port webpage with status (like squid to know what is happening)
 - if a remote end does not respect connection-close, use time to kill it anyway
 - look at all the method in http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918 and see what we can do with them
 - make sure we notice when a worker exit
 - incorporate DNS in main loop

After release:
