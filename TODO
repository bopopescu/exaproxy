Before realase :
 - fix all XXX:
 - http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2068#section-13.5.1
 - check any possible socket issues, to make sure all exception were traped (all errno are covered)
 - if a remote end / client does not respect connection-close, use time to kill it anyway
 - look at all the method in http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918 and see what we can do with them
 - make sure we notice when a worker exit
 - incorporate DNS in main loop
 - optionally add a Via header (ie: do follow RFC :p)
 - http://scotdoyle.com/python-epoll-howto.html
 - should we set NO_DELAY on the client side when CONNECT is used - should we use TCP_CORK otherwise ?
 - limit GET size as a option value (8192 default)

After release:
 - why pypy takes more CPU than cPython
 - look at regex for header parsing performance
 - improve perfs - always :D
 - look at FTP .... grrrr ...
