Before realase :
 - fix all XXX:
 - do not call time.time() on every iteration loop, use alarm ? which will stop blocking calls ?
 - http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2068#section-13.5.1
 - check any possible socket issues, to make sure all exception were traped (all errno are covered)
 - if a remote end / client does not respect connection-close, use time to kill it anyway
 - look at all the method in http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918 and see what we can do with them
 - make sure we notice when a worker exit
 - incorporate DNS in main loop
 - optionally add a Via header

After release:
 - why pypy takes more CPU than cPython
 - look at regex for header parsing performance
 - improve perfs - always :D
 - look at FTP .... grrrr ...
