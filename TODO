Allow Proxy Authentification :
 - http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2068#section-13.5.1

Question:
 - is HTTPResponse still used ?
 - are we getting rid of _html as a function (as we provide files)
 - header.py "self['host'] = 'Host: ' + host is not None" look like a bug to me
 - why self.commands in workers - thomas is removing this !
 
Before reelase :
 - fix all XXX:
 - fix all bug
   * Bad regex to extract CONNECT DATA (no http://)
   * We are sending twice connection:close, if there ?
 - check any possible socket issues, to make sure all exception were traped (all errno are covered)
 - some of the code should be moved down in lower class (multiple . deference)
 - have a 127.0.0.1:port webpage with status (like squid to know what is happening)
 - if a remote end does not respect connection-close, use time to kill it anyway
 - look at all the method in http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918 and see what we can do with them
 - find out what to do in case of host mismatch

still true ??
 - sometimes it look like the workers do not get the work even if the logs says we are pushing it to them


questions:
 - is EBADF a blocking errno to ignore ?

PYPY changing the FD of a socket to -1 !! Can we still work with pypy ?

The connection class track open connections co-routing which is good but does not work well.
In server we need to transition the download from having read to being just a buffer to send,
Those states are uncessary and this is were the design hurts.
